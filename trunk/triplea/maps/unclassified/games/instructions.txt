The "examples" folder contains several game xml's.
Because these games are not that popular, 
and because we do not want to crowd out our user's "Choose Games" menu with them,
so we have moved them to this "examples" folder.

Instructions on how to play these games:

1. Go into "examples" folder.
2. Click and drag the game xml files out of the "examples" folder, and into the "games" folder.  (or copy/cut and paste them there)
(the "games" folder is the same foldere that the "examples" folder is in)

After you do the above steps, the games will magically appear in your "Choose Games" menu.
Just close and relaunch TripleA, then click choose games.
