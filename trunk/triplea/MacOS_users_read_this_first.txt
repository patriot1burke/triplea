Attentional all Apple / Mac OS X users!

Apparently, Apple has decided to that from Mountain Lion onward, ALL SOFTWARE WILL BE BLOCKED BY DEFAULT by "Gatekeeper", unless the developers hand over $100 for a developer "ID".  

Currently, we do not have this ID, despite supporting Apple for the last 10 years.  So you may get one of the following messages when trying to install or use TripleA:
"TripleA" can't be opened because it was not downloaded from the Mac App Store.
"TripleA" can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.
"TripleA" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash.


So, in order to unblock TripleA, please take the following steps:

1. Open up "Gatekeeper"
Gatekeeper options are found in Apple menu > System Preferences… > Security & Privacy > General tab under the header "Allow applications downloaded from:"

2. Change "Allow Applications Downloaded From:" to "Anywhere"

3. You should now be able to intall and open and use TripleA (and any other software).

thanks,
