	<h2>Send to Web Site</h2>
    <p>
		A web poster will send the turn summary and save game with some additional meta information to a web server at the end of each players turn.
		The web server provides extended logic for dealing with the participating players.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is different from posting to a Forum, because you are posting to a customized website that is not a forum.  
		The website decides how to handle the game save and any other information.
	</p>
	<p>
		Web posters require a running and configured web server, to learn more click help again after selecting a specific web poster.
