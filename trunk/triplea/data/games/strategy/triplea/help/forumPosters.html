    <h2>Forum Poster</h2>
<p>
    A forum poster can post the turn summary and save game to a forum at the end of each players turn. This allows
    two or more players to play a game where you don't have to be online at the same time.

    The poster for each forum may be different so click help once you have selected a specific forum poster, to learn more.
