	<h2>Posts to a custom TripleA game website</h2>
	This poster will send your savegame to a website, where it can be accessed by you and your friends.
	The website will send out email notifications to whoever is the next player, that their turn is ready to start.
	The website may also show various statistics about the game in progress.
	<p>
		<h3>How to Use</h3>
			Starting new games:
		<ol>
			<li>The player which comes first (e.g. Russians) should set up a new game by setting the web site URL (e.g. 'http://triplea.myserver.com/') and
				must choose a game name. NOTE: Unicode characters (Umlauts, etc.) are not being handled correctly, yet!</li>
			<li>Click 'Initialize' and assign the players.</li>
			<li>After successful initialization click 'Play'.</li>
			<li>Make your move and post the game state at the end of your turn.</li>
		</ol>
		<br/>
			Making your turn:
		<ol>
			<li>The web site may send you an email, whenever it's your turn (if 'Send Mails' is checked)</li>
			<li>When it's your turn, download the latest save game from the TripleA game web site, load into TripleA, play and finally post at the end of your turn.</li>
		</ol>
		<br/>
			Managing your games:
		<ol>
			<li>There is currently not yet any way to set a game as won or lost, or to surrender a game.</li>
			<li>There is currently not yet any way for users to delete finished games.</li>
		</ol>

		</ol>
		<br/>
			Installation:
		<ol>
			<li>The public (sub-)domain or the dynamic DNS should point to your webserver.</li>
			<li>Get and extract the PHP scripts for your private TripleA game web site from X?X!?.</li>
			<li>Modify the settings.php file in order to adjust the list of human players.</li>
			<li>Upload the scripts to your webserver.</li>
		</ol>
		<br/>
			Managing your players and games:
		<ol>

			<li>The web site administrator needs to delete the according files in the 'games' folder at the server.</li>
		</ol>
