<h2>Email sender</h2>
    <p>
    An email sender can email the turn summary and save game to multiple recipients at the end of each players turn. This allows
    two or more players to play a game where you don't have to be online at the same time.
</p>
<p>
    Each email sender may require custom configuration, to learn more click help again after selecting a specific email sender.

<p>
	* Make sure you have registered for receiving dice emails if your dice server sends them out. Click the 'Help?' button by your dice server to see if this is required.
