Added a Swedish Barque to SZ20, to keep UK from capturing Swedish convoy round 1 (I recommend not attacking this barque with less than a BB, because you will lose a ship 1/4th of the time. You can go around the barque instead.)
Added Options for: Partial Amphibious Retreat (defaults false), Naval Bombardment Casualties Fire Back (defaults false), and Naval Bombard Restricted To Number of Units offloading (defaults true, to avoid bombard abuse).
Candia and convoy SZ73 are now UK, along with a starting UK fleet in 73.
France has a fleet off Egypt, ready to take it or return home.  France now owns SZ38 convoy zone.  Removed 2 French Fusilier from Poitou.

Fortress price lowered by 2 to 6, General lowered by 3 to 22.
Slight Changes to setup, more units for neutrals, 1 less artillery for ottomons, french force made more mobile, Gibraltar troops turned into fortresses, so that Spain can ignore taking Gibraltar without suffering if it chooses to, and created an austrian fleet of a single ship.


Version 2 - 2.4 changes:

Fixed bug: Dragoons now have Blitz, to match the chart.
All Neutral Grenadiers changed to Chasseurs.
Minor changes to unit startup with neutrals: less luck for defenses.
Minor changes to unit startup for Carolingians: all Dragoons turned into Hussars, plus extra Hussars for France.
