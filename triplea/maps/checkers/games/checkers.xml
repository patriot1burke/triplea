				<b>Checkers</b>
				<br />
				<br />Beta Test version by Veqryn
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers
				<br />
				<br /><b>How To Move Pieces</b> 
				<br />Click once on the piece (do not hold the mouse button down). 
				<br />Then Click once on where you want the piece to go. 
				<br />To Jump Over other pieces, right click (or shift/ctrl click) on those tiles in the middle. 
				<br />
				<br />So for example, we want to move from 0,0 to 2,2 to 4,4 (we are hopping over 2 pieces, at 1,1 and 3,3), 
				<br />Then we would click once on 0,0 then right click (or shift/ctrl click) on 2,2  then normal click on 4,4. 
				<br />
				<br />
				<br /><b>The Goal of Checkers</b> 
				<br />Checkers is a game played between two opponents on opposite sides of a board containing 64 squares of alternating colors. 
					Each player has 12 pieces. 
					Victory is achieved when you have captured all of the opponent's pieces, or prevented them from making any legal moves. 
				<br />
				<br /><b>How the Checkers Pieces Move</b> 
				<br />There are two types of pieces: pawns (men), and kings.  All pieces start as pawns. 
				<br />1. A simple move involves sliding a piece one space diagonally forward to an adjacent unoccupied dark square. 
				<br />2. A jump is a move from a square diagonally adjacent to one of the opponent's pieces to an empty square immediately and directly on the opposite side of the opponent's square, 
					thus jumping directly over the square containing the opponent's piece. 
				<br />An uncrowned piece may only jump diagonally forward, kings may also jump diagonally backward. A piece that is jumped is captured and removed from the board. 
				<br />Multiple-jump moves are possible if when the jumping piece lands, there is another immediate piece that can be jumped; even if the jump is in a different direction. 
				<br />Jumping is mandatory: whenever a player has the option to jump, that person must jump (even if it's to the jumping player's disadvantage; 
					for example, a player can choose to allow one of his men to get captured to set up capturing two or more of his/her opponent's men).
				<br />When multiple-option jumping moves are available, whether with the one piece in different directions or multiple pieces that can make various jumping moves, 
					the player may choose which piece to jump with and which jumping option or sequence of jumps to make. 
					The jumping sequence chosen does not necessarily have to be the one that would have resulted in the most captures; 
					however, one must make all available captures in the chosen sequence. Any piece, whether it is a king or not, can jump a king. 
				<br />
				<br /><b>Kings</b>
				<br />If a player's piece moves into the kings row (last row) on the opposing player's side of the board, that piece is said to be crowned, 
					becoming a king and gaining the ability to move both forward and backward. 
					If a player's piece jumps into the kings row, the current move terminates; having just been crowned, the piece cannot continue on by jumping back out (as in a multiple jump), until the next move.
