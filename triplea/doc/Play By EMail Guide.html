	<p><font size="5"><b>Practical Guidlines for PBE</b></font></p>
	<p>Playing
TripleA over the net allows for continuous Axis and Ally game play.
With it, you don&#8217;t need five or six hours dedicated to one game. You
can participate in a game whenever you can. You can even start a game
via the Client / Server model and continue it via PBE. You can exchange
the save game file via instant messenger, FTP server, or email and pick
it back up in a Client / Server game whenever you can. Here are some
general guidelines to help you keep your game play going.</p>
	<b>Selecting Casualties</b><br>
	<p>When
selecting casualties you should follow an agreed guideline. A common
guidline is to select casualties according to the cost of the piece.
For land units it would follow this order: Infantry, Artillery, Armor,
Fighters, Bombers. When losing a bomber in a land battle it would do
well to consider the interest of your opponent. If you would lose the
bomber before a fighter to hold onto the territory then do that with
your opponent&#8217;s best interest in mind</p>
	<p>Continuing
the example for sea battles, casualties would be selected in this
order: Transports, Submarines, Fighters, Destroyers, Loaded Transports,
Carriers, Battleships. Submersible submarines give exception; if a
submarine is by itself or with empty transports then it submerges on
the first round.</p>
	<b>Types of PBE play</b><br>
	<p>Standard
PBE: this kind of game is described in the TripleA documentation. You
select the PBE option and enter your email address and your opponents
email address. If there is more than two involved in the game you enter
your email address and the email address of the person whose turn
follows yours.</p>
	<p>Confirmable PBE: we use this kind of game to
keep the game easy on our inbox. You select the PBE option but you use
the groups email address. Create one email address for your group and
send all dice rolls to that address (use it for both email fields). The
group moderator should have the password to this email account. This
way dice rolls can still be confirmed if they are called into question
and no inboxes get flooded with dice results.</p>
	<p>Trust Game:  In this game we do not use the PBE option.</p>
	<b>Naming Schemes:</b>
	<p>Once
your turn is complete you send the save game file to the other players.
It is helpful to use a descriptive naming scheme. An example is using
the first initial of every player round &#8211; turn and version info. For
instance if nabiy, ud, and drec were playing version 0.4.6 and it was
Russia&#8217;s turn in the second round of play the name of the file should
be: nud2-1RS046.svg</p>
