<B>A:  Installing TripleA</B></P>
<HR>
<P>
There are two methods of installing TripleA, one is by downloading and
installing the pre-compiled version, while the other is downloading
the source code and compiling it your self. This section will go over
both methods and outline important points.
</P>

<P><B>1.0  Installing the pre-compiled version</B></P>
<P>
We will assume that you have already downloaded the pre-compiled version
and that you now have a file on your system called <B>&quot;triplea_x_x_x.zip&quot;</B>
The x's represent the current version number.
</P>
<P>
Once you have decided where on your system you would like to install
TripleA, it is now time to extract (or unzip) the contents of the
downloaded file. If your running a Windows operating system you
extract the file by using <B><A HREF="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</A></B> or
<B><A HREF="http://www.rarlabs.com">WinRAR</A></B> software. If
you have those installed on your computer, the file should have the
<B><A HREF="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</A></B> or <B><A HREF="http://www.rarlabs.com">WinRAR</A></B>
icon. You can double click on the file and the extraction program
will guide you to where you wish to unzip its contents.
</P>
<P>
Alternatively if you use Unix or a variant (such as Linux) you can unzip the file
using a GUI front end called <B>ARK</B>, or using command line tools
such as <B>unzip</B> (ie. unzip -L triplea_x_x_x.zip) that will
extract all of the contents into the current directory you are in.
Commands may vary from different flavors of *nix.
</P>
<P>
By now you should have been able to extract the TripleA zip file into a
directory. You will notice that you now have a folder called
<B>triplea_x_x_x</B> where TripleA's game files are. Thats basically
it on installing TripleA. You only need to extract all the files into
a directory or folder. From there on you just run the game.
</P>

<P><B>2.0  Installing From Source</B></P>
<P>
Why compile from source? There are actually many reasons, one being the
type of Java Virtual Machine you have installed. Some JVMs run
differently and compile java source code differently and may act
strange on other JVMs. An example is running java byte code that has
been compiled using Sun's JVM on a JVM done by IBM for example.
</P>

<P>
Some JVMs have different optimization features and other features that is
beyond the scope of this document. Though if you feel you need to
compile from source because you use a different JVM than SUN or maybe
because you just like compiling everything from source, then go right
ahead. No one is stopping you :)
</P>
<P>
To install TripleA from source you will need the source package which
you can download from the TripleA website. We shall assume you
already have this file downloaded and are ready to extract it's
contents.
</P>
<P>
The first step is to extract the contents of the zip file into a location
of your choice. Steps on how to extract the file can be found in
<B>Section A 1.0</B> of this document. Once you have extracted all
the files, you will see a folder named <B>&quot;triplea_x_x_x&quot;</B>. Note that
it has the same name as the pre-compiled package so if you are going
to install both the source and the pre-compiled version, it is highly
recommended that you create separate directories for them first. If
not one will overwrite the other.
</P>

<P>
Before you even begin compiling, you need:
<UL>
	<LI>Apache ANT (<A HREF="http://ant.apache.org">http://ant.apache.org</A>)
	<LI>Java JDK (<A HREF="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</A>)
	<LI>Junit (<A HREF="http://www.junit.org">http://www.junit.org</A>)
	<LI>.ant.properties (text file with config options)
</UL>

<P>
We assume you have ANT installed, as well as a suitable Java JDK
whose version is 1.4.x or higher, and Junit installed (you only need
to download the Junit package and unzip it somewhere on your system.
The .ant.properties file, if not included in the source package, you
will have to make your own, from which it will reference the Junit
installation directory.
</P>

<P>
Go into the directory where you extracted the TripleA source code.
Create a text file and name it exactly like so <B>&quot;.ant.properties&quot;</B>
Open this file and add the following information:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE>
		unit.jar=PATH TO THE JUNIT JAR FILE<BR>
		junit.home=PATH TO THE JUNIT DIRECTORY<BR>
		triplea.version=X_X_X<BR>
	</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
For a more suitable example
let me show you my <B>&quot;.ant.properties&quot;</B> file. It is on my Linux system
where I have Junit installed in my home directory.
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE>
		junit.jar=/home/necro/junit3.8.1/junit3.8.1.jar<BR>
		junit.home=/home/necro/junit3.8.1/<BR>
		triplea.version=0_4_2<BR>
	</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
These fields point to the location where Junit is installed
so that ANT can use them while you compile.
</P>

<P>
After you get a suitable <B>&quot;.ant.properties&quot;</B> file created, it is time to actually compile TripleA.
You will need to be in a DOS prompt, or some form of terminal/console/command prompt where you can type in commands.
In the base directory of TripleA, issue the command:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE>
		ant compile<BR>
	</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If everything has been set up properly it should compile TripleA and
yield a similar output as below. The output below is what shows up
when I run the command to compile my copy of TripleA:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE>
		Buildfile: build.xml<BR>
		init:<BR>
		compile:<BR>
		<BR>
		[echo] looking for junit.jar in:/home/necro/junit3.8.1/junit.jar, edit ant.properties to set junit location<BR>
		[javac] Compiling 321 source files to /home/necro/programs/triplea_src_4.1/classes<BR>
		<BR>
		BUILD SUCCESSFUL<BR>
		Total time: 8 seconds<BR>
	</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
A small note on using the <B>&quot;ant&quot;</B> you can issue one of the following commands
to <B>&quot;ant&quot;</B>. Each will yield a different result.<BR>
<UL>
	<LI>ant compile (Compiles all source files)</LI>
	<LI>ant clean (removes all previously compiled files and folders)</LI>
	<LI>ant compileClean (executes "ant clean" then "ant compile" in one go)</LI>
</UL>
There are more commands that can be used and you can find them in the <B>&quot;build.xml&quot;</B>
file. You can even make your own if you wish.<BR>
<BR>
After a successful compile, TripleA is now ready to be run.
</P>

<BR>
<P><H3><B>B:  Running TripleA</B></H3></P>
<HR>

<P>
Now that TripleA has been installed, either from the pre-compiled version
or from source, it is now time to actually run the game. This section will
go over how to run the game on various operating systems.
</P>

<P><B>1.0  Running TripleA on Windows</B></P>
<P>
Simply open Windows Explorer, or whatever program you use to browse files
around your computer. Find your TripleA folder and go inside the
<B>&quot;bin&quot;</B> folder. Inside there you should find a file called
<B>&quot;triplea.bat&quot;</B>This is the file that Windows users are expected to
double click on (or run through a DOS prompt) to get the game
started.
</P>

<P><B>2.0  Running TripleA on Unix/Linux/Irix/Mac OS X</B></P>
<P>
Go into the directory in which you installed TripleA. From there enter
the <B>&quot;bin&quot;</B> directory. You should see a file called <B>&quot;triplea.sh&quot;</B>
You will need to change the permissions on that file in order to make
it executable. Running the command:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE>
		chmod +x triplea.sh<BR>
	</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
will give the file executable permissions. Once that is
done you can run the actual file by issuing the command:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE>
		./triplea.sh<BR>
	</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This will cause the game to be run. Though the
<B>&quot;triplea.sh&quot;</B> file is not exactly a proper shell script it helps
us to distinguish the windows files from the others. The file itself
contains the command:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE>
		java -cp ../lib/patch.jar:../classes:../lib/plastic-1.2.0.jar games.strategy.engine.framework.GameRunner</FONT></P>
	</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This command can be run manually in the <B>&quot;bin&quot;</B> directory from a command
prompt but it is quite lengthy and tedious to write all the time.
That Java command has proved to work on most Unix,
Linux, Irix 6.5, and Mac OS X systems. If you encounter problems with
this command please log on to the TripleA message board and request
further assistance.
</P>

<BR>
<P><H3><B>C:  Starting a Local Game</B></H3></P>
<HR>

<P>
This section goes over what a local game is and how to get one up and running.
</P>

<P><B>1.0  What is a local game?</B></P>
<P>
A local game is one where TripleA is played on a single computer with
no other human opponents. You are basically playing the all the
nations on your own since there is not current AI implementation.
</P>

<P><B>2.0  Starting a local game</B></P>
<P>
When you run TripleA you should see a start up window with
a given list of options, as described in Fig 2.1
</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="CENTER" BORDER="0">
	<TR>
		<TD>
			<IMG SRC="images/TripleA_Doc_v1_html_m331252d3.png" ALT="">
		</TD>
	</TR>

	<TR>
		<TD>
			<B>Fig 2.1</B>
		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
As can be seen, the <B>&quot;Local Game&quot;</B> option is chosen by default when the
game is first run. You can see it in the first box labeled <B>&quot;Game Type&quot;</B>
that has two buttons. The button that has the label <B>&quot;Local Game&quot;</B> once
clicked will drop down more options to choose from.
</P>

<P>
A local game can be of any type, by default the classic A&amp;A game is
chosen. You can of course change this by clicking on the <B>&quot;File ...&quot;</B>
button located in the second box labeled <B>&quot;File.&quot;</B> This will show
you a window where you can select from various game types.
</P>

<P>
You can, as well, load a saved game. You do so by clicking on the <B>&quot;New&quot;</B>
button that is located next to the text <B>&quot;Start a New Game or Load a Saved?&quot;</B>
By clicking on the button next to the text it will drop
down more options. You want to click on the <B>&quot;Saved&quot;</B> option that
is presented once the button is clicked. Only after that do you click
on the <B>&quot;File ...&quot;</B> button and select the saved game you wish to load.
</P>

<P>
Once you have made up your mind on what kind of game you would like to
play. It is time to actually start the game. You hit the mighty
<B>&quot;Play&quot;</B> button and wait while the game loads. You could always hit
<B>&quot;Exit&quot;</B> and go over to your kitchen and get a refreshing drink.
</P>
<BR>

<P><H3><B>D:  Starting a Multi-player Game</B></H3></P>
<HR>

<P>
To start any multi-player game you need one person to host a server and
the other persons to connect to the server as clients. Who gets to be
the server is up to you and your opponents. Normally you would want
the server to be someone with a fast Internet connection that can
handle multiple connections though this does not have to be the case.
</P>

<P><B>1.0  Starting a Server</B></P>
<P>
To start a server you simple run TripleA as normal. When you see the
start up window, select <B>&quot;Server&quot;</B> as your game type like so in Fig 1.1</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="CENTER" BORDER="0">
	<TR>

	</TR>

	<TR>
		<TD>
			<B>Fig 1.1</B>
		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>


<P>
The moment you click on <B>&quot;Server&quot;</B> you will get a smaller window
popping up that asks for two extra types of input: Name and Port (Fig 1.2)
</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="CENTER" BORDER="0">
	<TR>
		<TD>
			<IMG SRC="images/TripleA_Doc_v1_html_m5c78b93f.png" ALT="">
		</TD>
	</TR>

	<TR>
		<TD>
			<B>Fig 1.2</B>
		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
In the <B>&quot;Name&quot;</B> field you enter the name of the server. It does not have
to be <B>&quot;Server,&quot;</B> it can be your name or practically anything. It
will be that name you choose that will identify you in the chat room.
That is merely the purpose of it.
</P>

<P>
In the <B>&quot;Port&quot;</B> field you have to enter at what port number TripleA will
listen to for connections. This will also be the port number that the
clients will have to connect to. The default port number TripleA sets
is 3300. This number can be changed to your heart's desire but note
that on many Unix like systems any port number below 1024 is reserved
and needs root (administrator) privileges to access. So it is always
a good idea to have a port number greater than 1024.
</P>

<P>
If you have a firewall running or a router, you will need to choose the port
number carefully. If you just run a firewall on your local machine,
then make sure you choose a port that allows incoming and outgoing
connections on that specified port. If you have a router that
requires you to use port forwarding or your on a LAN going through a
gateway, then it is your responsibility to set up your router, port
forwarding, firewall ...etc properly so that this works.
</P>

<P>
Once you have selected an appropriate name (maybe something intimidating)
and a port number you are sure will work. It is time to hit the <B>&quot;OK&quot;</B>
button and move on to the next stage. A chat window will appear that
will look like so in Fig 1.3
</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="CENTER" BORDER="0">

		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Some interesting things to note about the chat window. For every message
being typed, the window will automatically be brought to the front.
This avoids you missing out on important messages if the window gets
lost behind other windows. For every message being sent a sound will
play (you can disable this once the game starts). Lastly, you can
right click on a person's name and have the option to <B>&quot;Slap&quot;</B>
them. This will show a message that you <B>&quot;Slapped&quot;</B> them and the
person being slapped with hear the sound of a machine gun being
played. You can use this to alter someone or something.
</P>

<P>
Aside from the chat window, you will notice that the same start-up window
is still there. What you need to do is click on the <B>&quot;Server Tab&quot;</B>
from which you can see some editable server properties. By default
the server is selected to play all countries, so your going to have
to change that. You also get to see what IP address TripleA is using
for the multi-player game, see Fig 1.4.
</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="CENTER" BORDER="0">

		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
This has become and increasingly troubling issue when you do not see the
IP address that you use to log on to the Internet but rather see your
Ethernet address, LAN, address of local host address. You should not
be able to see your local host (127.0.0.1) address since TripleA
automatically discards the loopback address. It has been seen that on
some strange network setups, that it detects the LAN address, and on
some proper setups it detects the gateway's Internet address (which
is what we want) instead of the LAN address of the current computer.
For more information on how TripleA detects the IP addresses please
refer to programmer comments in the IPFinder.java source code file.
</P>

<P>
Assuming everything is going as planned, you can give out your IP address to
your friends so that they can connect to you. Then you wait for them
to connect, chat a bit, edit some of the options...etc. Clicking on
the <B>&quot;Properties Tab&quot;</B> will allow you to change some game rules as
seen in Fig 1.5.

</P>

<P><B>2.0  Connecting to a server as a client</B></P>

<P>
When there is already one person acting as a server and you have their IP
address and their port number, then your ready to connect as a client.
First off you need TripleA running (yes it is obvious), where the <B>&quot;Game Type&quot;</B>
labeled box is select <B>&quot;Client&quot;</B> like so in Fig 2.1.
</P>

</TABLE>

<P>
The moment you click on <B>&quot;Client&quot;</B> you will be presented with a smaller
window that will give you three options: Name, Server Port, and
Server Address, see Fig 2.2.
</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="CENTER" BORDER="0">

</TABLE>

<P>
In the <B>&quot;Name&quot;</B> field you simply enter in any name you want to use. This
will identify your self in the chat room. In the <B>&quot;Server Port&quot;</B>
field you will enter the port number that the person hosting the
server decided to choose. This goes the same for the <B>&quot;Server Address&quot;</B>
field. Whoever is the server will have to give you those
two piece of information for you to fill in. Once you filled in the
appropriate fields you can safely click on the <B>&quot;Connect&quot;</B> button.
</P>

<P>
Once you see a chat window appear then you know you have successfully
connected to the server. The server is responsible for choosing what
countries they will play and each client is responsible for picking
what country they will play. This can be done by looking at the
TripleA start-up window and at the top clicking on the <B>&quot;Client&quot;</B>
tab. You will see a list of countries and check boxes adjacent to them.
</P>

<P>
Once everyone has decided what country to play, it is up to the server to
start the game. If the server is taking a while, feel free to slap
them in the chat room. Right click on their name and <B>&quot;Slap&quot;</B>
</P>
<BR>

<P><H3><B>E:  Play By Email (PBEM)</B></H3></P>
<P>
TripleA's PBEM mode allows multiple players to play a turn each and send each
other the saved game file. This allows them to play the game with each other
with out being connected to the internet for long periods of time. The dice rolls
done in a PBEM game are rolled by a 3rd party who emails each player the dice rolls
and each email is PGP signed and can be verified from their website. The server being
 used to roll the dice is located at <A HREF="http://www.irony.com/mailroll.html">http://www.irony.com/mailroll.html</A>
</P>

<P>
<B>IMPORTANT NOTE</B> Although PBEM does work in TripleA there is one problem
you will have to face. When engaing in a battle, your opponent <U>cannot</U> select
their own casualties! You have to select their casualty for them! This may not be a
big deal for some but it is for most.
</P>

<P>
To start playing a PBEM game you have to load up TripleA. At the startup window you
select the <B>&quot;PBEM&quot;</B> option from the <B>&quot;Game Type&quot;</B> list.
After that is done you will notice a <B>&quot;PBEM&quot;</B> tab show up next to the
<B>&quot;Properties&quot;</B> tab, you will click on that.
</P>

<P>
There are multiple email address fields. You fill them out approprietly with your email
address and your opponent's email address. This means that when you play the game all
dice rolls will be emailed to those addresses you specified. To verify that those email
addresses work and to verify that the dice rolling server is also working, you click on
the <B>&quot;Test Mail&quot;</B> button. You should see a small window appear showing the
results of the tests. It is also wise to check your email to see if the mail arrived and
what it says in there.
</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="CENTER" BORDER="0">

	</TR>

	<TR>
		<TD>
			<B>Fig 1.0</B>
		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Once the test succeeds then you can begin the game by hitting the <B>&quot;Play&quot;</B>button.
You play your turn and (as mentioned in the first paragraph above) during battle you have to select
your opponent's casualties because you cannot save the game in the middle of a battle. Once you finished
your turn, you save your game and send the saved game file to your opponent.
</P>

<P>
The steps your opponent have to take to load the PBEM game are as follows. They load up TripleA as normal.
Select <B>&quot;PBEM&quot;</B> from the <B>&quot;Game Type&quot;</B> options list. Then, in the same place
they choose to load a <B>&quot;Saved&quot;</B> game. They browse their computer and select the PBEM saved game
file that their opponent sent them. Once they have selected the PBEM saved game file, they are now ready to
click on the <B>&quot;PBEM&quot;</B> tab located at the top of the window. Once they are in that section, they
have to fill out the email addresses approprietly as done above (can also opt to hit <B>&quot;Test Mail&quot;</B>).
When that is done they can hit the <B>&quot;Play&quot;</B> button. They will see that they are now at the last place
their opponent left off at (obviously). They do their turn and save it when they are done and send it to their
opponent. And the cycle continues.
</P>

<P>
<B>Possible PBEM Workarounds</B><BR>
<BR>
Since opponents cannot select their own casualties, you can have a general consensus with your opponents
on what casualties should be selected at what kinds of battle scenarios. These actions can be double checked
by checking the emails that the dice server sends. So if someone cheats and kills off 5 tanks instead of 5
infantry, it will be painfully obvious of the foul play.
<BR>
<BR>
Players can engage in what is called a "Hot-Potato" game. This is when around a minimum of 2 or a maximum of 5
players wish to play a game with each other. What happens is that one person plays a local game on their computer
being allies, conducts their turn, plays the battles, and at the end of their turn they save the game. Once the
game is saved they e-mail it to the next person to play their turn. This goes on being saved and sent to each player
until the game is over.<BR>
<BR>
Some rules need to be agreeded on before doing such a game. One of them will be to agree on what casualties to select
when conducting a battle. Since a battle will be done by 1 person and that person has to select the casualties of their
opponents and whether or not to submerge their submarines. Come to a general consensus about what to do. This is not a
bad idea since you actually can double check what each player did, thanks to TripleA's history mode. You can look back
and see exactly what happened, and what dice were rolled. This way you can verify if there was foul play. Of course if
you notice that someone has been cheating and killed off your fighters instead of your infantry for example... then you
can opt to stop the game and never play with that person again. Choosing opponents will be of utmost importance here. Make
sure you play with people who won't cheat on you.<BR>
<BR>
One down side would that anyone could re-play their turn over and over until they get suitable dice. You cannot do much about
this but as mentioned above.. you should play with people who you can trust will not do that. Even if this is done, in the end
strategy wins over dice rolls.<BR>

</P>

<P><B>2.0 Finding Opponents</B></P>

<P>
The best place to find an opponent is on the message board. There is a
special section dedicated for scheduling games in advanced. This is
especially useful for those players who have busy lives and can't pop
in the IRC chat room five times a day to check if someone just
happens to be there and just happens to have at least 3 hours set
aside for a game.
</P>

<P>
The message board allows you some time to schedule a game and get
opponents that are willing to play with you at a specific time. They
can later meet up in the TripleA IRC chat room (more info on at
<A HREF="http://triplea.sourceforge.net/finding_oponents_irc.html">http://triplea.sourceforge.net/finding_oponents_irc.html</A>)
It is not mandatory to meet in the IRC chat room to start a game, but it
is there if anyone needs a place to meet or chat with some of the
developers. Sometimes we go in there and chat a bit.

<P>
The chat room can also be accessed through the <A HREF="http://maddlinks.com/triplea/index.php">message board</A>'s <B>Chat</B>
button at the top of the page. It is a Java IRC applet so make sure you have a Java enabled browser.
