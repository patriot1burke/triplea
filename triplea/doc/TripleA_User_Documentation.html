		<h2><a name="sec_a">Installing TripleA</a></h2>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				This section will go over installing TripleA from its pre-compiled form.
				By this we mean that TripleA has been already pre-compiled and you don't
				need to compile it.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				To play the game you must first install a java virtual machine on your
				computer. The game requires at least the JDK 1.4. If you have already
				installed a java virtual machine then you can skip this step.<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>Windows</b> and <b>Linux</b> users can download the Java Runtime Engine
				(JRE) from Sun Microsystems at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.java.com/en/index.jsp">www.java.com/en/index.jsp</a>.
				<br/><br/>
				<b>Mac</b> users must be using <b>Mac OS X</b> to run the game. <b>Mac OS X</b>
				comes pre-installed with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), but it may only be Java 1.3.
				<b>Mac</b> users can install Java 1.4 or greater from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/java">here</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>Windows</b> users must update the path variable before playing the game.
				Please see <a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/install-windows.html">Step 5 Update the PATH variable<a>
				for instructions.
			</p>
						
			<p>
				To install TripleA you will, obviously, need a downloaded copy of the
				pre-compiled version of TripleA. Usually you can tell if it is pre-compiled
				by looking at the name of the file. The file name should look like this:
				<blockquote>
				<code>
					triplea_x_x_x.zip
				</code>
				</blockquote>
				Where the <b>x</b> character is replaced by the version number. The non-compiled
				version will have the word <b>source</b> appended to the end of the file name.
				So if you accidently downloaded the source version and not the pre-compiled version,
				then go back and download the pre-compiled version.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				You will need to decide where you want to install TripleA. We currently cannot
				provide an automatic installer for all Operating System's platform so you will
				need to extract the contents of the TripleA Zip file to a specified location on
				your computer.<br/>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Once you have decided where on your system you would like to install TripleA, 
				it is now time to extract (or unzip) the contents of the downloaded file. If 
				your running a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com">Windows</a>
				operating system you extract the file by using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</a>
				or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rarlabs.com">WinRAR</a> software. If 
				you have those installed on your computer, the file should have the WinZip or
				WinRAR icon. You can double click on the file and the extraction program will
				guide you to where you wish to unzip its contents.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Alternatively if you use Unix or a Unix variant (such as Linux) you can unzip
				the file using a GUI front end called <b>ARK</b>, or using command line tools
				such as <b>unzip</b>. The unzip command should work on both <b>Linux</b> and
				<b/>Mac OS X</b>:
				<blockquote>
				<code>
					unzip -L triplea_x_x_x.zip
				</code>
				</blockquote>
				That will extract all of the contents of the zip file into the current directory
				you are in. Commands may vary from different flavors of *nix.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				By now you should have been able to extract the TripleA zip file into a directory.
				You will notice that you now have a folder called <b>triplea_x_x_x</b> where TripleA's
				game files are. Thats basically it on installing TripleA. You only need to extract all
				the files into a directory or folder.<br/>
				<br/>
				From here you can proceed to <a href="#sec_c">Running TripleA</a>

		<h2><a name="sec_b">Compiling TripleA Source Code</a></h2>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Before we start, please note that it is <b>NOT</b> required that you install Triplea
				from source (that is compiling it your self). You can run the game using the pre-compiled
				version as mentioned above in <a href="#sec_a">Installing TripleA</a>.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				There are actually many reasons, one being the type of Java Virtual Machine you have installed,
				to want to compile TripleA from source and install it. Some JVMs run differently and compile
				java source code differently and may act strange on other JVMs. An example is running java byte
				code that has been compiled using Sun's JVM on a JVM done by IBM for example.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Some JVMs have different optimization features and other features that is beyond the scope of
				this document. Though if you feel you need to compile from source because you use a different JVM
				than SUN or maybe because you just like compiling everything from source, then go right ahead. No
				one is stopping you :)
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This section will be devided into two sections, one for the Win32 (Windows) platform and the
				other for the GNU/Linux platform. The instructions on how to compile TripleA on GNU/Linux are
				relatively similar (if not exactly the same) as the Mac OS X platform and other UNIX variants
				that are out there. Compiling instructions on other platforms are not supported by the TripleA
				team unless someone wishes to donate instructions.
			</p>
			
			<h2><a name="sec_b_1">Compiling on Windows</a></h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					To install TripleA from source you will need the source package which you can download from the
					TripleA website. We shall assume you already have this file downloaded and are ready to extract
					it's contents.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The first step is to extract the contents of the zip file into a location of your choice.
					Once you have extracted all the files, you will see a folder named <b>triplea_x_x_x</b>.
					Note that it has the same name as the pre-compiled package so if you are going to install
					both the source and the pre-compiled version, it is highly recommended that you create
					separate directories for them first. If not one will overwrite the other.
				</p>
			
				<p>
					Before you even begin compiling, you need:
					<ul>
						<li>Apache ANT (<a target="_blank" href="http://ant.apache.org">http://ant.apache.org</a>)</li>
						<li>Java JDK (<a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>)</li>
						<li>Junit (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.junit.org">http://www.junit.org</a>)</li>
						<li>.ant.properties (text file with config options)</li>
					</ul>
				
					The <i>.ant.properties</i> file should be included with your Triplea source download. 
					You will need to modify it in using <b>Word Pad</b> <i>not</i> Note Pad.<br/>
					<br/>
					F.Y.I. make sure you download Java SDK SE (Standard Edition) and <i>not</i> the EE (Enterprise Edition.)
					Most users find it difficult to get the Enterprise Edition working. On top of that you don't need it
					to compile TripleA.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					You should consider installing both the <b>Java SDK</b> and <b>Ant</b> at the root level of the C: drive.
					It is known that <b>Ant</b> in particular sometimes doesn't like spaces in the path name (nor for the path to be extremely long).
					You'll notice that the typical default Windows install location of <b>&quot;Program Files&quot;</b> will
					in fact have a space in its path. It is not known how often this truly causes a problem (if ever), but the "pros"
					say they install their compiling programs to their root C: directory to avoid pitfalls so it is recommended
					that you do the same. The last thing we would want is &quot;extra&quot; problems.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					For simplicity's sake, we shall install both the <b>Java SDK SE</b> and <b>Ant</b> at the root or C: Drive  
					as well as <b>TripleA</b> and <b>JUnit</b>. JUnit is easily installed, you just need to extract the contents
					of it into it's own folder. TripleA just needs to use a single JAR file that comes with JUnit.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Once you've installed the <b>Java SDK SE</b>, <b>JUnit</b> and <b>Ant</b> on your PC, start the Command Prompt
					(terminal) program. In Windows XP it's under: 
					<blockquote>
					<code>
						Start > All Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt.
					</code>
					</blockquote>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In Command Prompt, enter &quot;Java -version&quot; (without the quotes) and hit enter. If you see information
					for the default Windows Java version instead of the new Java SDK SE you've just downloaded and installed...
					then Windows is not recognizing your newer Java install as the proper default. That's okay, fact it's almost
					to be expected.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Now in Command Prompt enter &quot;Ant -version&quot; (without quotes) and hit enter. You will probably see a
					message as such:
					<blockquote>
					<code>
						&quot;Ant is not recognized as a internal or external command, operable program or batch file.&quot;
					</code>
					</blockquote>
					
					I had the same problem myself and it took me a couple days searching online and reading to find what you need
					to do on a PC. Even though you've correctly installed Java SDK and Ant, Windows doesn't seem to recognize this.
					We can fix that.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					To get Windows to recognize <b>Java SDK SE</b> and <b>Ant</b> from the Command Prompt, here's what you need to do.
					Go to:
					<blockquote>
					<code>
						 Control Panel -> System -> Advanced (tab) -> Environmental Variables (button)
					</code>
					</blockquote>
				</p> 

				<p>
					Here we will add information for Windows to recognize both programs so it will pass your Command Prompt calls
					to the right place. You will want to make the following additions to the &quot;User Variables&quot; section
					at the top and <b>NOT</b> the System Variables.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					There is no good reason to make these additions as System Variables unless you absolutely need all user
					accounts on your PC to be able to run these command line programs. Are the kids really going to be
					compiling Triplea using their own Windows log-in? Yikes! Besides, messing around with your System Variables
					is risky because (unlike the User Variables) it has the potential to really mess your system up if you enter
					something wrong. So let's take the safe road and simply enter the following as User Variables. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Under &quot;User Variables&quot;, (not system variables) click on the &quot;New&quot; button and enter the
					following information:
					<blockquote>
					<code>
						Variable name: JAVA_HOME<br/>
						Variable value: C:\j2sdk1.4.2_04
					</code>
					</blockquote>
					
					The Variable Name should be entered exactly as indicated. The Variable Value will be your exact path to
					the <b>Java SDK SE</b> folder... so obviously your entry here may vary depending on your install path
					and the folder name you've chosen. I've only shown my Variable Value entry an example here.
				</p>
				
				
				<p>
					The easiest way to get this path exactly correct is to open the <b>Java SDK SE</b> folder and select a subfolder
					inside (<b>bin</b> folder, for example) then view the properties on it. The "Location" shown in the properties
					window will be the path you need to enter here, and you can simply select it and copy/paste it in to avoid any typos. 
					<blockquote>
					<code>
						Click OK
					</code>
					</blockquote>
				</p>

				<p>
					Under &quot;User Variables&quot;, click on the &quot;New&quot; button again and enter the following information:
					<blockquote>
					<code>
						Variable name: ANT_HOME<br/>
						Variable value: C:\apache-ant-1.6.2
					</code>
					</blockquote>
				</p>

				<p>
					Here again the Variable Name should be entered exactly as indicated. The Variable Value will be the path to
					your Ant folder and again, your exact entry may vary. I've only shown my entry as an example here. Use the
					trick above to get the path right using copy/paste. 
					<blockquote>
					<code>
						Click OK
					</code>
					</blockquote>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Under &quot;User Variables&quot;, click on the &quot;New&quot; button one last time and enter the following information:
					<blockquote>
					<code>
						Variable name: PATH<br/>
						Variable value: C:\j2sdk1.4.2_04\bin\;C:\apache-ant-1.6.2\bin\
					</code>
					</blockquote>

					The Variable Name should be entered exactly as shown. The Variable Value will be your exact paths to the BIN folders
					located inside both the Java SDK and Ant folders, with the 2 entries separated by a semi-colon &quot;;&quot; and no spaces between
					them. Once again, my entry is shown for example only. Be sure to include the trailing \ after bin (\bin\) in the path names. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Click OK. Now click OK to the Environmental Variables window, then OK to the System Properties window.
				</p> 
				
				<p>
					Now for an important step. In order for these changes to take effect you must either log out then back in, OR restart your PC. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Once you have done that, then fire up the Command Prompt program again.<br/>
					Enter "java -version" again and hit enter. This time you should see something like:
					<blockquote>
					<code>
						Java version "1.4.2_04"<br/>
						Java (TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_04-b05)<br/>
						Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2_04-b05, mixed mode)
					</code>
					</blockquote>
				</p>

				<p>
					Now enter "ant -version" again and hit enter.<br/>
					This time you should see something like:
					<blockquote>
					<code>
						Apache Ant version 1.6.2 compiled on July 16 2004
					</code>
					</blockquote>

					If you get an error... recheck your Environmental Variables entries and proofread your paths very carefully.
					Did you copy/paste the paths to avoid typos? You did restart or log out/in didn't you? Review the instructions
					again and double check everything. But if all goes well you should get the proper returns from your Command
					Prompt version check.
				</p>

				<p>
					OK, now that Windows is ready to pass the Command Prompt commands to the proper places you're ready to give
					this a spin. You've already modified the .ant.properties file in the Triplea source folder to point to Junit,
					right? The Users Manual covers editing this to point to the junit.jar file, but just for sake of completeness
					my .ant.properties file was edited in Wordpad like so:
					<blockquote>
					<code>
						junit.jar=C:junit3.8.1\junit.jar<br/>
						triplea.version=0_5_1
					</code>
					</blockquote>
				</p>

				<p>
					In the Command Prompt, before issuing the &quot;ant compile&quot; command I found it necessary to change the directory
					to point to the Triplea source folder first. Otherwise it wouldn't work. I even tried using an nifty Ant
					specific command which is supposed to prompt Ant to look through the directories hierarchy searching for
					a suitable build.XML file. But this didn't work for me either.
				</p>

				<p>
					To change directories in Command Prompt you use the &quot;cd&quot; command. Type in &quot;cd C:\&quot; and hit enter.
					This will take you to the root level of the C: drive. If you enter &quot;dir&quot; and hit enter, this will display
					the contents of your present directory (including all the invisible system files).
				</p>

				<p>
					Now if you placed your Triplea source folder at C: root level, simply change directory again &quot;cd&quot; to the
					Triplea source folder by entering: &quot;cd triplea_0_5_1&quot; (of course you could have done all of this in one
					shot... by entering &quot;cd C:\triplea_0_5_1&quot; ...just giving you an idea how to navigate around directories using the
					cd command.)
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Command Prompt should now look like this:
					<blockquote>
					<code>
						C:\triplea_0_5_1>
					</code>
					</blockquote>

					Now you are ready to issue the &quot;ant compile&quot; command in Command Prompt and hit enter... 
					You should see something like this:
					<blockquote>
					<code>
						Buildfile: build.xml<br/>
						init:<br/>
						compile:<br/>
						[echo] looking for junit.jar in:C:junit3.8.1junit.jar, edit .ant.properties to set junit location<br/>
						[mkdir] Created dir: C:\Triplea_0_5_1\classes<br/>
						[copy] Copying 359 files to C:\triplea_0_5_1\classes<br/>
						BUILD SUCCESSFUL<br/>
						Total time: 29 seconds
					</code>
					</blockquote>
					Success!<br/><br/>
					TripleA is now ready to be <a href="#sec_c">Run</a>.

			<h2><a name="sec_b_2">Compiling on GNU/Linux and other variants</a></h2>
			<blockquote>
			<p>
				To install TripleA from source you will need the source package which you can download from the
				TripleA website. We shall assume you already have this file downloaded and are ready to extract
				it's contents.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The first step is to extract the contents of the zip file into a location of your choice.
				Once you have extracted all the files, you will see a folder named <b>triplea_x_x_x</b>.
				Note that it has the same name as the pre-compiled package so if you are going to install
				both the source and the pre-compiled version, it is highly recommended that you create
				separate directories for them first. If not one will overwrite the other.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Before you even begin compiling, you need:
				<ul>
					<li>Apache ANT (<a target="_blank" href="http://ant.apache.org">http://ant.apache.org</a>)</li>
					<li>Java JDK (<a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>)</li>
					<li>Junit (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.junit.org">http://www.junit.org</a>)</li>
					<li>.ant.properties (text file with config options)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				We assume you have <b>ANT</b> installed, as well as a suitable <b>Java JDK</b> whose version is 1.4.x or higher,
				(a slight warning! if you use Java v1.5 you may experience instability and incompatibility with other version of
				TripleA compiled against v1.4), and <b>Junit</b> installed (you only need to download the Junit package and unzip
				it somewhere on your system. The <b>.ant.properties</b> file, if not included in the source package, you will have
				to make your own, from which it will reference the Junit installation directory.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Go into the directory where you extracted the TripleA source code. Create a text file and name it exactly like so
				<b>.ant.properties</b> Open this file and add the following information:
				
				<blockquote>
				<code>
					 junit.jar=PATH TO THE JUNIT JAR FILE<br/>
					 triplea.version=X_X_X
				</code>
				</blockquote>
				
				For a more suitable example let me show you my <b>.ant.properties</b> file. It is on my Linux system where I have
				<b>Junit</b> installed in my home directory.
				
				<blockquote>
				<code>
					 junit.jar=/home/necro/junit3.8.1/junit3.8.1.jar<br/>
					 triplea.version=0_5_1
				</code>
				</blockquote>
				These fields point to the location where <b>Junit</b> is installed so that <b>ANT</b> can use them while you compile.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				After you get a suitable <b>.ant.properties</b> file created, it is time to actually compile TripleA. You will need to
				be in a DOS prompt, or some form of terminal/console/command prompt where you can type in commands. In the base directory
				of TripleA, issue the command:
				<blockquote>
				<code>
					ant compile
				</code>
				</blockquote>
				If everything has been set up properly it should compile TripleA and yield a similar output as below. The output below is
				what shows up when I run the command to compile my copy of TripleA:
				<blockquote>
				<code>
					Buildfile: build.xml<br/>
					init:<br/>
					compile:<br/>
					[echo] looking for junit.jar in:/home/necro/javabox/junit3.8.1/junit.jar, edit .ant.properties to set junit location<br/>

					<br/>
					BUILD SUCCESSFUL<br/>
					Total time: 18 seconds<br/>
				</code>
				</blockquote>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A small note on using the <b>ant</b> you can issue one of the following commands to
				<b>ant</b>. Each will yield a different result:
				<blockquote>
					<ul>
						<li><b>ant compile</b> (Compiles all source files)</li>
						<li><b>ant clean</b> (removes all previously compiled files and folders)</li>
						<li><b>ant compileClean</b> (executes <b>ant clean</b> then <b>ant compile</b> in one go)</li>
						<li><b>ant zip</b> (Compiles the source code and packages it in a zip file)</li>
						<li><b>ant zipSource</b> (Pacakges TripleA and the source in a zip file without compiling)</li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>
				There are more commands that can be used and you can find them in the <b>build.xml</b> file. You can even make your
				own if you wish.<br/>

			<p>
				Now that TripleA has been installed, either from the pre-compiled version or from source, it is now time to
				actually run the game. This section will go over how to run the game on various operating systems.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<h4>Running On Windows</h4>
				Simply open Windows Explorer, or whatever program you use to browse files around your computer. Find your
				TripleA folder and go inside the <b>bin</b> folder. Inside there you should find a file called <b>triplea.bat</b>
				This is the file that Windows users are expected to double click on (or run through a DOS prompt) to get
				the game started.<br/>
				<br/>
				You can make shortcuts pointing to <b>triplea.bat</b> and you can as well use some of our TripleA icons that are
				provided in the <b>icons</b> folder.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<h4>Running on Unix/Linux/Irix/Mac OS X</h4>
				Go into the directory in which you installed TripleA. From there enter the <b>bin</b> directory. You should see a file
				called <b>triplea.sh</b> You will need to change the permissions on that file in order to make it executable. Running
				the command:
				<blockquote>
				<code>
					 chmod +x triplea.sh
				</code>
				</blockquote>
				That will give the file executable permissions. Once that is done you can run the actual file by issuing the command:
				<blockquote>
				<code>
					./triplea.sh
				</code>
				</blockquote>
				This will cause the game to be run. Though the <b>triplea.sh</b> file is not exactly a proper shell script it helps
				us to distinguish the windows files from the others. Though if one wants, they can skip the step to <b>chmod</b> the
				file and directly exectue it with the following:
				<blockquote>
				<code>
					 sh triplea.sh
				</code>
				</blockquote>
				The file itself contains the command:
				<blockquote>
				<code>
					 java -cp ../lib/patch.jar:../classes:../lib/plastic-1.2.0.jar games.strategy.engine.framework.GameRunner
				</code>
				</blockquote>
				This command can be run manually in the <b>bin</b> directory from a command prompt but it is quite lengthy and
				tedious to write all the time. That Java command has proved to work on most Unix, Linux, Irix 6.5, and Mac OS X
				systems. If you encounter problems with this command please log on to the <a target="_blank" href="http://maddlinks.com/triplea">TripleA message board</a>
				and request further assistance.<br/>

			<h2><a name="sec_c_1">Local Game</a></h2>
			<p>
				This section goes over what a local game is and how to get one up and running.<br/>
				<br/>
				A local game is one where TripleA is played on a single computer with no other human opponents. You are basically
				playing the all the nations on your own. There is an experimental computer opponent but it is very primitive. The
				AI works best with Classic Edition and will not work well with 4th Edition games.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				When you run TripleA you should see a start up window with a given list of options, as described in <b>Fig 1.0</b>
				<table align="center" border="0">
					<tr>
						<td>
							<img src="images/TripleA_Doc_v1_html_m331252d3.png" width="276" height="323" border="0" alt="">

				</table>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As can be seen, the <b>Local Game</b> option is chosen by default when the game is first run. You can see it in the first box labeled
				<b>Game Type</b> that has two buttons. The button that has the label <b>Local Game</b> once clicked will drop down more options to
				choose from.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A local game can be of any type, by default the classic A&A game is chosen. You can of course change this by clicking on the
				<b>File ...</b> button located in the second box labeled <b>File.</b> This will show you a window where you can select from
				various game types.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				You can, as well, load a saved game. You do so by clicking on the <b>New</b> button that is located next to the text
				<b>Start a New Game or Load a Saved?</b> By clicking on the button next to the text it will drop down more options.
				You want to click on the <b>Saved</b> option that is presented once the button is clicked. Only after that do you
				click on the <b>File ...</b> button and select the saved game you wish to load.

				Once you have made up your mind on what kind of game you would like to play. It is time to actually start the game.
				You hit the mighty <b>Play</b> button and wait while the game loads. You could always hit <b>Exit</b> and go over
				to your kitchen and get a refreshing drink.<br/>

			<h2><a name="sec_c_2">Multiplayer Game</a></h2>
			<p>
				To start any multi-player game you need one person to host a server and the other persons to connect to the server
				as clients. Who gets to be the server is up to you and your opponents. Normally you would want the server to be
				someone with a fast Internet connection that can handle multiple connections though this does not have to be the case.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<h4>Starting A Server</h4>
				To start a server you simple run TripleA as normal. When you see the start up window, select <b>Server</b> as your
				game type like so in <b>Fig 1.1</b>
				<table align="center" border="0">
					<tr>
						<td>
							<img src="images/TripleA_Doc_v1_html_m612b180b.png" width="276" height="323" border="0" alt="">
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<b>Fig 1.1</b>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				The moment you click on <b>Server</b> you will get a smaller window popping up that asks for two extra types of
				input: Name and Port (<b>Fig 1.2</b>):
				<table align="center" border="0">
					<tr>
						<td>
							<img src="images/TripleA_Doc_v1_html_m5c78b93f.png" width="153" height="121" border="0" alt="">
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<b>Fig 1.2</b>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				In the <b>Name</b> field you enter the name of the server. It does not have to be &quot;Server,&quot; it can be
				your name or practically anything. It will be that name you choose that will identify you in the chat room.
				That is merely the purpose of it.<br/>
				<br/>
				In the <b>Port</b> field you have to enter at what port number TripleA will listen to for connections. This will
				also be the port number that the clients will have to connect to. The default port number TripleA sets is 3300.
				This number can be changed to your heart's desire but note that on many Unix like systems any port number below
				1024 is reserved and needs root (administrator) privileges to access. So it is always a good idea to have a port
				number greater than 1024.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If you have a firewall running and/or are behind a router, you will need to choose the port number carefully.
				If you just run a firewall on your local machine, then make sure you choose a port that allows incoming and
				outgoing connections on that specified port. If you are behind a router it is most likely that TripleA will
				detect your computer's LAN IP address (that is those standard 198.162... ip addresses). Don't be alarmed for
				this is the proper IP TripleA must see as it connects TripleA to the router. Now you will need to setup
				<b>PORT FORWARDING</b> for your router. Making it forward all incomming and outgoing connections on port 3300
				to your computer. This is a very important step as many users don't configure this properly. There is more
				information about this as well with screenshots of how to setup port forwarding <a target="_blank" href="http://maddlinks.com/triplea/viewtopic.php?t=275">here</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Once you have selected an appropriate name (maybe something intimidating) and a port number you are sure will
				work. It is time to hit the <b>OK</b> button and move on to the next stage. A chat window will appear that
				will look like so in <b>Fig 1.3</b>:
				<table align="center" border="0">
					<tr>
						<td>
							<img src="images/TripleA_Doc_v1_html_43e1017.png" width="301" height="203" border="0" alt="">
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<b>Fig 1.3</b>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				Some interesting things to note about the chat window. For every message being typed, the window will
				automatically be brought to the front. This avoids you missing out on important messages if the window
				gets lost behind other windows. For every message being sent a sound will play (you can disable this
				once the game starts). Lastly, you can right click on a person's name and have the option to <b>Slap</b>
				them. This will show a message that you <b>Slapped</b> them and the person being slapped with hear the
				sound of a machine gun being played. You can use this to alter someone or something.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Aside from the chat window, you will notice that the same start-up window is still there. What you need
				to do is click on the <b>Server Tab</b> from which you can see some editable server properties. By default
				the server is selected to play all countries, so your going to have to change that. You also get to see
				what IP address TripleA is using for the multi-player game, see <b>Fig 1.4</b>:
				<table align="center" border="0">
					<tr>
						<td>
							<img src="images/TripleA_Doc_v1_html_5b06051b.png" width="275" height="323" border="0" alt="">
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<b>Fig 1.4</b>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				This has become and increasingly troubling issue when you do not see the IP address that you use to log on
				to the Internet but rather see your Ethernet address, LAN, address of local host address. You should not
				be able to see your local host (127.0.0.1) address since TripleA automatically discards the loopback address.
				If you do see your LAN ip address then that means your behind a router, and if you have port forwarding setup
				correctly, the game will run fine. You just need to give them the internet address of your router so they
				can connect to that.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Assuming everything is going as planned, you can give out your IP address to your friends so that they can
				connect to you. Then you wait for them to connect, chat a bit, edit some of the options...etc. Clicking on
				the <b>Properties Tab</b> will allow you to change some game rules as seen in <b>Fig 1.5</b> for 4th Edition
				Options.
				<table align="center" border="0">
					<tr>
						<td>
							<img src="images/TripleA_Doc_v1_html_1efc9d25.png" width="277" height="334" border="0" alt="">
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<b>Fig 1.5</b>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				Only the Server can start the game by hitting the <b>Play</b> button.<br/>
				<br/>
				<a href="#top">- Top -</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<h4>Connecting to a server as a client</h4>
				When there is already one person acting as a server and you have their IP address and their port number,
				then your ready to connect as a client. First off you need TripleA running (yes it is obvious), where
				the <b>Game Type</b> labeled box is select <b>Client</b> like so in <b>Fig 1.6</b>:
				<table align="center" border="0">
					<tr>
						<td>
							<img src="images/TripleA_Doc_v1_html_m612b180b.png" width="276" height="323" border="0" alt="">
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<b>Fig 1.6</b>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				The moment you click on <b>Client</b> you will be presented with a smaller window that will give you three
				options: Name, Server Port, and Server Address, see <b>Fig 1.7</b>:
				<table align="center" border="0">
					<tr>
						<td>
							<img src="images/TripleA_Doc_v1_html_2a0c3a72.png" width="203" height="144" border="0" alt="">
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<b>Fig 1.7</b>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In the <b>Name</b> field you simply enter in any name you want to use. This will identify your self in the
				chat room. In the <b>Server Port</b> field you will enter the port number that the person hosting the server
				decided to choose. This goes the same for the <b>Server Address</b> field. Whoever is the server will have
				to give you those two piece of information for you to fill in. Once you filled in the appropriate fields
				you can safely click on the <b>Connect</b> button.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Once you see a chat window appear then you know you have successfully connected to the server. The server
				is responsible for choosing what countries they will play and each client is responsible for picking what
				country they will play. This can be done by looking at the TripleA start-up window and at the top clicking
				on the <b>Client</b> tab. You will see a list of countries and check boxes adjacent to them.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Once everyone has decided what country to play, it is up to the server to start the game. If the server is
				taking a while, feel free to slap them in the chat room. Right click on their name and <b>Slap</b>. 
			</p>
			
			<h2><a name="sec_c_3">Play By E-Mail</a></h2>
			<p>
				TripleA's PBEM mode allows multiple players to play a turn each and send each other the saved game file.
				This allows them to play the game with each other with out being connected to the internet for long
				periods of time. The dice rolls done in a PBEM game are rolled by a 3rd party who emails each player
				the dice rolls and each email is PGP signed and can be verified from their website. The server being
				used to roll the dice is located at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.irony.com/mailroll.html">http://www.irony.com/mailroll.html</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b> Although PBEM does work in TripleA there is one problem you will have to face.
				When engaing in a battle, your opponent cannot select their own casualties! You have to select their
				casualty for them! This may not be a big deal for some but it is for most.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				To start playing a PBEM game you have to load up TripleA. At the startup window you select the <b>PBEM</b>
				option from the <b>Game Type</b> list. After that is done you will notice a <b>PBEM</b> tab show up next
				to the <b>Properties</b> tab, you will click on that.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There are multiple email address fields. You fill them out approprietly with your email address and your
				opponent's email address. This means that when you play the game all dice rolls will be emailed to those
				addresses you specified. To verify that those email addresses work and to verify that the dice rolling
				server is also working, you click on the <b>Test Mail</b> button. You should see a small window appear
				showing the results of the tests. It is also wise to check your email to see if the mail arrived and
				what it says in there.
				<table align="center" border="0">
					<tr>
						<td>
							 <img src="images/TripleA_Doc_v1_html_26989e0b.png" width="277" height="325" border="0" alt="">
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<b>Fig 1.8</b>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Once the test succeeds then you can begin the game by hitting the <b>Play</b> button. You play your
				turn and (as mentioned in the first paragraph above) during battle you have to select your opponent's
				casualties because you cannot save the game in the middle of a battle. Once you finished your turn,
				you save your game and send the saved game file to your opponent.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The steps your opponent have to take to load the PBEM game are as follows. They load up TripleA as
				normal. Select <b>PBEM</b> from the <b>Game Type</b> options list. Then, in the same place they
				choose to load a <b>Saved</b> game. They browse their computer and select the PBEM saved game
				file that their opponent sent them. Once they have selected the PBEM saved game file, they are
				now ready to click on the <b>PBEM</b> tab located at the top of the window. Once they are in that
				section, they have to fill out the email addresses approprietly as done above (can also opt to hit
				<b>Test Mail</b>). When that is done they can hit the <b>Play</b> button. They will see that they
				are now at the last place their opponent left off at (obviously). They do their turn and save it
				when they are done and send it to their opponent. And the cycle continues.<br/>
				<br/>
			</p>
			
			<h4>Possible PBEM Work Arounds</h4>
			<p>
				Since opponents cannot select their own casualties, you can have a general consensus with your
				opponents on what casualties should be selected at what kinds of battle scenarios. These actions
				can be double checked by checking the emails that the dice server sends. So if someone cheats and
				kills off 5 tanks instead of 5 infantry, it will be painfully obvious of the foul play. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Players can engage in what is called a "Hot-Potato" game. This is when around a minimum of 2 or
				a maximum of 5 players wish to play a game with each other. What happens is that one person plays
				a local game on their computer being allies, conducts their turn, plays the battles, and at the
				end of their turn they save the game. Once the game is saved they e-mail it to the next person
				to play their turn. This goes on being saved and sent to each player until the game is over.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Some rules need to be agreed on before doing such a game. One of them will be to agree on what
				casualties to select when conducting a battle. Since a battle will be done by 1 person and that
				person has to select the casualties of their opponents and whether or not to submerge their
				submarines. Come to a general consensus about what to do. This is not a bad idea since you actually
				can double check what each player did, thanks to TripleA's history mode. You can look back and see
				exactly what happened, and what dice were rolled. This way you can verify if there was foul play.
				Of course if you notice that someone has been cheating and killed off your fighters instead of
				your infantry for example... then you can opt to stop the game and never play with that person
				again. Choosing opponents will be of utmost importance here. Make sure you play with people who
				won't cheat on you.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				One down side would that anyone could re-play their turn over and over until they get suitable
				dice. You cannot do much about this but as mentioned above.. you should play with people who
				you can trust will not do that. Even if this is done, in the end strategy wins over dice rolls.

			<h2><a name="sec_c_4">Practical Guidlines for PBEM</a></h2>
			<p>
				Playing TripleA over the net allows for continuous Axis and Ally game play. With it, you don’t
				need five or six hours dedicated to one game. You can participate in a game whenever you can.
				You can even start a game via the Client / Server model and continue it via PBE.  You can exchange
				the save game file via instant messenger, FTP server, or email and pick it back up in a Client /
				Server game whenever you can.  Here are some general guidelines to help you keep your game play going.
			</p>

			<p>
				<h4>Selecting Casualties</h4>
				When selecting casualties you should follow an agreed guideline. 
				A common guidline is to select casualties according to the cost of the piece.  
				For land units it would follow this order:  Infantry, Artillery, Armor, Fighters, Bombers.  
				When losing a bomber in a land battle it would do well to consider the interest of your opponent.  
				If you would lose the bomber before a fighter to hold onto the territory then do that with your opponent’s
				best interest in mind
			</p>

			<p>
				Continuing the example for sea battles, casualties would be selected in this order:  Transports, Submarines,
				Fighters, Destroyers, Loaded Transports, Carriers, Battleships.  Submersible submarines give exception; if a
				submarine is by itself or with empty transports then it submerges on the first round.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Types of PBE play</h4>
			
			<p>
				<b>Standard PBE</b>: this kind of game is described in the TripleA documentation.  You select the PBE option
				and enter your email address and your opponents email address.  If there is more than two involved in the
				game you enter your email address and the email address of the person whose turn follows yours.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				<b>Confirmable PBE</b>: we use this kind of game to keep the game easy on our inbox.  You select the PBE
				option but you use the groups email address.  Create one email address for your group and send all dice
				rolls to that address (use it for both email fields).  The group moderator should have the password to
				this email account.  This way dice rolls can still be confirmed if they are called into question and no
				inboxes get flooded with dice results.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				<b>Trust Game</b>:  In this game we do not use the PBE option.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<h4>Naming Schemes</h4>
				Once your turn is complete you send the save game file to the other players. It is helpful to use a
				descriptive naming scheme. An example is using the first initial of every player round – turn and
				version info.  For instance if nabiy, ud, and drec were playing version 0.4.6 and it was Russia’s
				turn in the second round of play the name of the file should be: <b>nud2-1RS046.svg</b>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<a href="#top">- Top -</a>
			</p>
			
			<h2><a name="sec_c_5">About Low Luck</a></h2>
			<p>
				Low luck is a methodology for rolling dice which reduces the variance 
				inherent in dice rolling. It guarantees that the number of hits in a 
				certain set of rolls will not differ from the average number of hits by 
				more than one. The details of the implementation as well as a general 
				discussion of low luck can be found in the DAAK club at  
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.daak.de/aarll/aarllregel.php?sprache=e">http://www.daak.de/aarll/aarllregel.php?sprache=e</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The low luck option can be enabled by putting a checkmark in the box 
				next to "Low Luck" in the properties tab before the game is started. 
				This option must be specified by the server in a multiplayer game. Low 
				luck has not been tested for PBEM games.  The current implementation 
				does not support low luck rolling for SBR's or techs, instead normal 
				rules are used in these two cases. The number of dice rolled in a phase 
				of a battle should never be more than one. The number of hits will be 
				indicated at the bottom of the combat window and will be equal to the 
				number of guaranteed hits plus one if the only dice rolled is a hit. No 
				dice may be rolled if the outcome is guaranteed because no fractional 
				dice are needed.<br/>

				<b>A:</b>Are you running the command in the <b>bin</b> directory? type <b>pwd</b>, and the result should end in <b>/bin</b>.
				If you are not in the <b>bin</b> directory, change your directory. It could also mean your accidently downloaded the source package
				of TripleA instead of the pre-compiled package. This happens when you run TripleA when it has not been compiled.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>Q:</b>I get &quot;Unable to create server socket: Connection timed out: connect&quot;!<br/>
				<b>A:</b>This basically means TripleA could not find the server to connect to. Are you behind
				a Firewall that is blocking you? Is the server behind a Firewall blocking your connections? Is
				your router set up properly for Port Forwarding? Or maybe the server went offline.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>Q:</b>No matter how many times I re-download TripleA, it keeps saying it is corrupted!<br/>
				<b>A:</b>Try using a different UnZipping utility. If that doesn't work try re-downloading TripleA
				using a different program. There was a case where Mozilla browser kept saving the Zip file in a
