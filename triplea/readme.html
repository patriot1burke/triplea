<h3>
	Playing:
</h3>

On windows to play the game you simply double click on the triplea.bat file in the bin directory.  
On Mac and Linux you will have to modify the triplea.bat file to orient the slashes the correct way.  
<br>
There is currently a bug that makes the game <a href='http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=575502&group_id=44492&atid=439737'>look really bad in Linux</a>.  I plan on fixing this after I get a linux box set up.  If your a java developer with access to a linux box Im pretty sure the problem is in the  games.strategy.triplea.image.MapImage class.  I havent heard any reports of the game working or not working on macs, so Im assuming everything is fine.

<h3>
	Common Problems:
</h3>


If you run the game and you get an error message that says 'Bad command or file name', then you havent installed or set up the java virtual machine correctly.  Please see the <a href="http://triplea.sourceforge.net/install.html">installation page</a> for instructions on setting up a java virtual machine on your computer.
